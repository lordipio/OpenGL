# Galaga Clone Game 🎮

This is my custom **Galaga Clone**, created using **OpenGL**. Developing this game was a fantastic learning experience where I explored and applied various fundamental concepts of graphics programming and game development.

## 🚀 Features
- **Smooth Frame Manipulation**: Implemented animations and frame rendering for a polished gaming experience.
- **Rendering**:
  - Created and managed **VAOs** (Vertex Array Objects), **VBOs** (Vertex Buffer Objects), and **IBOs** (Index Buffer Objects) for efficient rendering.
- **Model Transformations**:
  - Learned and applied the **Model Matrix** for transformations, including:
    - Translation (Positioning)
    - Rotation
    - Scaling
  - Integrated **Projection** and **View** matrices for accurate 3D rendering.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**:
  - Developed core game functionality inspired by the classic *Galaga*.
  - Designed interactive controls for the player to move and shoot.
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Implemented **circle collision detection** for dynamic interactions between the player and meteors (enemies).

## 🧠 What I Learned
Working on this project significantly enhanced my understanding of:
- The graphics pipeline and how to leverage OpenGL for real-time rendering.
- I used leveraging design patterns like object pooling for optimized game mechanics.
- Manipulating frames and animations to create smooth and responsive gameplay.
- Using mathematical transformations (Model, View, Projection) to manipulate objects in a 2D space.
- Efficiently structuring vertex data using **VAO**, **VBO**, and **IBO**.
- Implementing collision detection for game objects using mathematical principles.

## 🔧 Tools and Technologies
- **Language**: C++, C, GLSL
- **Graphics API**: OpenGL
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Add power-ups for the player.
- Introduce multiple enemy types with unique movement patterns.
- Implement a scoring system and leaderboards.
